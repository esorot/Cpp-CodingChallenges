# Cpp-CodingChallenges
Collection of coding challenges solved in C++

At the beginning of each program will be a description of the problem and where the problem was first encountered or introduced, 
which might be the actual source or origin of the problem. Source is commented to provide descriptions or techniques which may
or may not have seem "obvious." If at all possible, each problem will be broken down into different categories based of the 
"nature" of the problem. Of course certain problems will and can fall into different categories. I'll do my best to label them as
I learn myself. Primary following the "Competitive Programming 3" by Steven Halim and Felix Halim.
